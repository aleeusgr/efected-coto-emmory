## [What is PBL?](https://www.pblworks.org/what-is-pbl)
Project Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching method in which students learn by actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects.

## How to run?
nix won't `run` so use the long way: `clone`, nix `develop`, cargo `test | run`,nix `flake update`,
TODO, describe UAT:  cargo `run` makes a Swagger UI accessible in the browser. Find the port and link to the doc.
